# Security Enhancements Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security features implemented to enhance the PIN authentication system and overall application security. These features provide enterprise-grade protection against common attack vectors including brute force attacks, account takeovers, and unauthorized access.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. PIN Rate Limiting & Account Lockout

**Purpose**: Prevent brute force attacks on PIN verification endpoints.

**Implementation**:
- **PIN Attempt Limit**: 5 failed attempts per phone number within 15 minutes
- **Account Lockout**: 15-minute lockout after 5 failed attempts
- **Progressive Warnings**: Users receive warnings after 3 failed attempts
- **Multi-Session Protection**: Lockout applies across all user sessions

**Technical Details**:
```javascript
// Configuration
const MAX_PIN_ATTEMPTS = 5;               // Maximum attempts before lockout
const LOCKOUT_DURATION = 15 * 60 * 1000;  // 15 minutes lockout
const ATTEMPT_WINDOW = 15 * 60 * 1000;    // 15 minutes attempt window
```

**Endpoints Protected**:
- `/api/pin/verify-pin` - Full security stack
- `/api/pin/set` - Full security stack  
- `/api/pin/create-pin` - Full security stack
- `/api/pin/change-pin` - Full security stack

### 2. Global API Rate Limiting

**Purpose**: Protect against DoS attacks and excessive API usage.

**Implementation**:
- **Request Limit**: 1,000 requests per IP per 15 minutes
- **Global Application**: Applied to all API endpoints
- **Headers**: Standard rate limit headers included in responses
- **Logging**: Security alerts logged for rate limit violations

**Technical Details**:
```javascript
// Applied to all routes
app.use(globalRateLimit);

// Configuration
windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,  // 15 minutes
max: 1000,                 // 1000 requests per window
```

### 3. Progressive Delay System

**Purpose**: Add increasing delays for repeated failed attempts.

**Implementation**:
- **Delay Trigger**: After 2 PIN attempts within 15 minutes
- **Initial Delay**: 500ms per additional attempt
- **Maximum Delay**: 20 seconds maximum delay
- **Key-based**: Tracks by phone number and IP address

**Technical Details**:
```javascript
// Progressive delay configuration
delayAfter: 2,      // Start delay after 2 attempts
delayMs: 500,       // 500ms delay per attempt
maxDelayMs: 20000,  // Maximum 20 second delay
```

### 4. Device Fingerprinting

**Purpose**: Track and limit device usage for enhanced security.

**Frontend Implementation**:
- **Canvas Fingerprinting**: Unique device rendering characteristics
- **Hardware Detection**: CPU cores, memory, screen resolution
- **Browser Fingerprinting**: User agent, language, timezone
- **Network Information**: Connection type and speed (when available)

**Backend Tracking**:
- **Device Registration**: Automatic registration of new devices
- **Device Limit**: Maximum 5 devices per user account
- **Security Alerts**: Notifications for new device registrations
- **Device Blocking**: Automatic blocking when device limit exceeded

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
import { getDeviceFingerprint } from '../utils/deviceFingerprinting';

const fingerprint = await getDeviceFingerprint();
// Automatically included in all API requests via X-Device-Fingerprint header
```

### 5. IP-based Attack Protection

**Purpose**: Block IPs with excessive failed attempts across all users.

**Implementation**:
- **IP Attempt Limit**: 20 failed attempts per IP per 15 minutes
- **IP Lockout**: 1-hour lockout for aggressive IPs
- **Cross-User Protection**: Protects all users from single malicious IP
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired blocks automatically removed

### 6. Enhanced Security Logging

**Purpose**: Comprehensive audit trail for security incidents.

**Log Categories**:
- `SECURITY_ALERT`: Critical security events requiring attention
- `SECURITY_PIN_ATTEMPT`: All PIN attempt activities (success/failure)
- `SECURITY_LOCKOUT_DENIED`: Access denied due to lockouts
- `SECURITY_DEVICE_REGISTRATION`: New device registrations
- `SECURITY_MAINTENANCE`: Security data cleanup operations

**FRA Compliance**:
- All logs include FRA compliance markers
- Digital Identity Ledger integration
- Regulatory audit trail maintained
- Privacy-safe logging (masked phone numbers)

### 7. Session Security Integration

**Purpose**: Integrate security features with session-based authentication.

**Features**:
- **Device Fingerprint Headers**: Automatically included in all API calls
- **Session Tracking**: Security events tied to specific sessions
- **Multi-Session Updates**: Security status updated across all user sessions
- **Token Security**: JWT tokens with device binding

## Security Middleware Architecture

### Security Middleware Stack

The `pinSecurityStack` provides comprehensive protection:

```javascript
const pinSecurityStack = [
  globalRateLimit,           // Global API rate limiting
  ipProtectionMiddleware,    // IP-based attack protection
  pinRateLimit,             // PIN-specific rate limiting
  accountLockoutMiddleware, // Account lockout protection
  progressiveDelay,         // Progressive delay system
  validateDeviceFingerprint // Device fingerprinting validation
];
```

### Middleware Application

**High Security (PIN Operations)**:
- PIN verification, creation, and changes
- Full security stack applied
- Maximum protection for authentication endpoints

**Medium Security (General Operations)**:
- Wallet operations, profile access
- Global rate limiting applied
- Standard API protection

**Low Security (Public Endpoints)**:
- Status checks, public information
- Basic rate limiting only
- Minimal security overhead

## Security Data Management

### In-Memory Storage

**Current Implementation**:
- PIN attempts tracking: `Map<phoneNumber, attemptData>`
- Device fingerprints: `Map<phoneNumber, Set<fingerprints>>`
- IP attempts: `Map<ipAddress, attemptData>`

**Production Recommendations**:
- Migrate to Redis for persistence and scalability
- Implement distributed rate limiting
- Add cross-server security data synchronization

### Data Cleanup

**Automatic Cleanup**:
- Runs every 5 minutes
- Removes expired lockouts
- Cleans up stale attempt data
- Maintains performance and memory usage

## Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **PIN Attack Metrics**:
   - Failed PIN attempts per hour
   - Account lockouts triggered
   - Progressive delays applied

2. **API Security Metrics**:
   - Rate limit violations
   - Blocked IP addresses
   - Device registration attempts

3. **System Health**:
   - Security data cleanup stats
   - Memory usage of security maps
   - Response time impact of security middleware

### Alert Thresholds

**Critical Alerts**:
- More than 10 account lockouts per hour
- More than 5 IP blocks per hour
- Device limit exceeded alerts

**Warning Alerts**:
- High rate limit usage (>80% of limit)
- Unusual device registration patterns
- Progressive delay triggering frequently

## Testing Security Features

### Manual Testing

1. **PIN Rate Limiting**:
   ```bash
   # Test PIN attempts
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/pin/verify-pin \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"pin":"wrong","phoneNumber":"+1234567890"}'
   ```

2. **Global Rate Limiting**:
   ```bash
   # Rapid API calls to trigger rate limit
   for i in {1..1001}; do
     curl http://localhost:3001/api/user/profile
   done
   ```

3. **Device Fingerprinting**:
   - Open browser developer tools
   - Check network requests for `X-Device-Fingerprint` header
   - Verify device registration logs in server

### Automated Testing
