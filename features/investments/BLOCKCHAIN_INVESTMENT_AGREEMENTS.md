# Blockchain Investment Agreements

## Overview
The Pend platform now features a **revolutionary blockchain-based investment agreement system** that stores legal agreements on-chain and records user consent signatures as immutable digital contracts. This provides tamper-proof regulatory compliance for FRA + Regulation S requirements.

## Core Components

### Smart Contract: InvestmentAgreement.sol
- **Purpose**: Store investment agreement text on-chain and record user signatures
- **Location**: `hardhat/contracts/InvestmentAgreement.sol`
- **Deployment**: Automated via `hardhat/scripts/deploy-investment-agreement.js`

### Key Features
- **Immutable Agreement Storage**: Full legal text stored permanently on blockchain
- **Digital Signature Recording**: User consent with timestamps, wallet addresses, IP hashes
- **Version Control**: Support for multiple agreement versions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete signature history with verification status
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets FRA and Regulation S requirements

## Smart Contract Functions

### Admin Functions (Owner Only)
- `createAgreement(poolId, agreementText, agreementHash)` - Store new agreement version
- `updateValidator(address)` - Change validator address
- `transferOwnership(address)` - Transfer contract ownership

### Validator Functions
- `signAgreement(poolId, phoneNumber, userWallet, investmentAmount, ipAddress)` - Record user signature
- `verifySignature(poolId, phoneNumber)` - Verify signature after OTP

### Public View Functions
- `getAgreementText(poolId)` - Get current agreement text for display
- `hasUserSigned(poolId, phoneNumber)` - Check if user signed current version
- `getUserSignatures(poolId, phoneNumber)` - Get user's signature history
- `getSignatureCount(poolId)` - Get total signatures for pool

## Frontend Integration

### Updated Components
- **HarvestInvestModal.tsx**: Complete rewrite to use blockchain
- **config.ts**: Added contract address and ABI configuration

### User Flow
1. **Investment Input**: User enters investment amount
2. **Blockchain Agreement**: Agreement loaded from smart contract
3. **Digital Signature**: User signature recorded on blockchain
4. **OTP Verification**: Standard OTP flow with blockchain confirmation

- **Cost Effective**: One-time deployment, perpetual use

## Technical Implementation

### Contract Deployment
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-investment-agreement.js --network besu
```

### Configuration
```typescript
// Frontend config.ts
INVESTMENT_AGREEMENT_ADDRESS: '0xE3eA516F348f9cF126b13432Fe8725fad8C832D2'
INVESTMENT_AGREEMENT_VALIDATOR: '0xeaf4197108Dd5810EC0f6036ee0e6E77621a2E39'
```

### Data Flow
1. **Agreement Loading**: Frontend → Smart Contract → Display on UI
2. **User Signature**: Frontend → Server API → Smart Contract (via validator)
3. **OTP Process**: Standard flow with blockchain confirmation
4. **Investment**: Server verifies blockchain signature before processing
