# Pend Pool & Bundle System

## Overview

The Pool & Bundle system represents the next evolution of Pend's investment marketplace, enabling users to invest in **curated portfolios of real-world assets** rather than individual opportunities. This system transforms Explore from a single-asset marketplace into a strategic investment platform offering diversified, thematic, and risk-balanced portfolios.

## 🏗️ Current Implementation Status

### ✅ **Smart Contract Foundation**

#### **HarvestPool Contract** 
```solidity
contract HarvestPool {
    address public immutable P_EGP;      // pEGP stablecoin
    HarvestToken public immutable HVT;   // LP token
    uint256 public nav;                  // Net Asset Value
    bool public useDynamicNAV;          // Toggle manual/automatic NAV
    uint256 public totalProfitsDeposited; // Cumulative profit tracking
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Dynamic NAV Calculation**: `NAV = TVL ÷ HVT Supply`
- ✅ **Profit Distribution**: `depositProfits()` function automatically increases NAV for all holders
- ✅ **Flexible Redemption**: NAV-based redemption with liquidity checks
- ✅ **Governance Controls**: Owner-managed with transparent profit reporting
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Supports both manual and automatic NAV modes

#### **Supporting Infrastructure**
- ✅ **HarvestToken (HVT)**: ERC-20 LP tokens representing pool shares
- ✅ **AssetFactory Integration**: Framework for deploying pool-wrapped assets
- ✅ **ConsentManager Compatibility**: Pool investments require same tier/consent checks

### 🚧 **In Development: Bundle UI Integration**

**Current Gap**: While `HarvestPool` smart contracts are production-ready, the UI currently only shows individual asset listings. Bundle/pool opportunities need to be integrated into the Explore tab.

**Required Components:**
- Bundle listings in `ExploreCard` component
- Pool-specific investment flow in `DepositOptionsModal`
- Bundle detail views in `OpportunityDetail`
- Pool performance tracking in `WalletTab`

## 🎯 **Bundle System Architecture**

### **What Is a Bundle?**

A Bundle is a **smart contract-managed portfolio** that aggregates multiple Explore-verified assets into a single investment opportunity:

- **Curated Selection**: 3-20 tokenized assets selected by verified managers
- **Shared Redemption**: Unified exit logic across all underlying assets  
- **NAV-Based Pricing**: Token value reflects real-time performance of holdings
- **Legal Clarity**: Each bundle inherits compliance from underlying assets
- **Transparent Composition**: Users can view exact asset allocation and weights

### **Bundle Types (Planned)**

| Bundle Category | Description | Asset Mix | Target ROI | Lock Period |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Agri Income Bundle** | Harvest-based agricultural returns | 6+ farms (dates, olives, cotton) | 9-13% annually | 18 months |
| **Urban Rental Yield** | Real estate income streams | Apartments + medical centers | 10-15% annually | 2-3 years |
| **Shariah Compliant Mix** | Halal-verified asset portfolio | Agriculture + logistics + healthcare | 8-12% annually | Variable |
| **Diaspora Access** | MENA expat investment packages | Mixed regional opportunities | 7-11% annually | 12 months |
| **Energy Transition** | Renewable energy projects | Solar + wind + storage | 8-14% annually | 3-5 years |

### **Bundle Creation Process**

#### **1. Asset Selection & Curation**
```javascript
// Conceptual bundle structure
const bundleComposition = {
  name: "Agri Income Q1 2025",
  assets: [
    { tokenAddress: "0xFARM1...", weight: 30, assetType: "Date Farm" },
    { tokenAddress: "0xFARM2...", weight: 25, assetType: "Olive Grove" },
    { tokenAddress: "0xFARM3...", weight: 20, assetType: "Cotton Field" },
    { tokenAddress: "0xHONEY...", weight: 25, assetType: "Apiary" }
  ],
  totalAllocation: 100,
  manager: "Agrix SPV",
  lockupMonths: 18
}
```

#### **2. Smart Contract Deployment**
- Bundle contract deployed via `BundleFactory` (planned)
- Inherits from `HarvestPool` for NAV and redemption logic
- Links to underlying asset tokens with predefined weights
- Embeds consent, tier, and jurisdiction requirements

#### **3. Validator Review & Approval**
- Bundle composition reviewed by domain validator (e.g., `agrix`, `propbase`)
- Legal documentation verified for all underlying assets
- Risk assessment and disclosure preparation
- Metadata publication and Explore listing approval

### **How Users Interact with Bundles**

#### **Investment Flow**
1. **Browse Bundles**: Appear in Explore alongside individual assets, filterable by "Bundle" category
2. **Review Composition**: Detailed view shows all underlying assets, weights, performance history
3. **Investment Process**: Same flow as individual assets (currency → payment → amount → agreement → OTP)
4. **Token Issuance**: Receive bundle tokens (e.g., `AGRI-Q1-2025`) representing proportional ownership
5. **Performance Tracking**: Bundle NAV updates based on underlying asset performance

#### **Bundle Detail View**
```typescript
interface BundleDetails {
  composition: AssetAllocation[];
  currentNAV: number;
  totalInvestors: number;
  distributionHistory: ProfitDistribution[];
  redemptionSchedule: RedemptionWindow[];
  legalDocuments: Document[];
  manager: AssetManagerProfile;
}
```

## 🔄 **Redemption Mechanisms**

### **1. NAV-Based Redemption**
```solidity
function redeem(uint256 bundleTokens) external {
    uint256 currentNAV = getDynamicNAV();
    uint256 egpAmount = (bundleTokens * currentNAV) / 1e18;
    // Process redemption at current NAV
}
```

**How It Works:**
- Bundle NAV = Total Value of Underlying Assets ÷ Bundle Token Supply
- Redemption value calculated in real-time based on current portfolio performance
- Available after lock-up period expires (typically 12-36 months)

### **2. Buffer Redemption (Instant Exit)**
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public redemptionBuffer;

function instantRedeem(uint256 bundleTokens) external {
    require(bundleTokens <= maxBufferRedemption(), "Exceeds buffer limit");
    // Process immediate redemption from stablecoin buffer
}
```

**How It Works:**
- Bundle maintains 5-15% stablecoin buffer for instant redemptions
- Funded from early profits, treasury reserves, or manager credit lines
- First-come-first-served basis until buffer depleted
- Remaining redemptions queue for next liquidity cycle

### **3. Cycle-Based Redemption**
**Agricultural Bundles**: Redemption windows open after harvest seasons
**Real Estate Bundles**: Aligned with lease renewal periods
**Energy Bundles**: Annual or quarterly based on power purchase agreements

### **4. Queued Redemption**
When instant liquidity is unavailable:
- Users submit redemption requests via smart contract
- Requests processed as new investments arrive or assets mature
- Queue position and estimated fulfillment date provided
- Prevents forced liquidation of underlying assets

## 🧑‍⚖️ **Bundle Management & Governance**

### **Who Can Manage Bundles?**

| Manager Type | Authority | Responsibilities |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Pend Core** | Deploy flagship bundles | Create reference implementations, maintain quality standards |
| **Domain Validators** | Sector-specific bundles | Agriculture (Agrix), Real Estate (PropBase), Energy (GreenTech) |
| **Licensed Asset Managers** | B2B onboarded partners | Regional specialists, institutional managers |
