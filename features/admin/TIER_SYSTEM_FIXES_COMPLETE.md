# Tier System Fixes - Complete Implementation

## Summary of All Fixes Completed

### 1. ✅ Fixed React Hooks Error

**Problem**: "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error causing app crashes.

**Root Cause**: State changes in useEffect were causing early returns before all hooks were executed.

**Solution**: 
- Moved wallet existence check to component initialization
- Set initial step based on saved wallet instead of changing it in useEffect
- Ensures consistent hook execution on every render

```typescript
// Before - Problematic
useEffect(() => {
  if (savedWallet && step === 0) {
    setStep(7); // Could cause early return
  }
}, [step, setWalletAddress]);

// After - Fixed
const savedWallet = getStorageItem('walletAddress');
const initialStep = savedWallet ? 7 : 0;
const [step, setStep] = useState<0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7>(initialStep);
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed DeviceManagementService

**Problem**: Non-existent TierUpgradeService methods being called.

**Solution**:
- Removed calls to `registerDeviceConsent()` and `removeDeviceConsent()`
- Device registration now only stores locally during wallet creation
- Proper messaging guides users to Settings for blockchain tier upgrade

### 3. ✅ Fixed TierUpgradeService

**Problem**: Local storage fallback causing tier mismatches.

**Solution**:
- Removed `calculateTierFromLocalStorage()` method
- `getCurrentTier()` now only reads from blockchain
- Removed non-existent device consent methods
- All tier data comes from ConsentManager smart contract

### 4. ✅ Fixed TierUpgradeModal

**Problem**: Consent verification not using correct action names.

**Solution**:
- Updated to use proper action names: `register_device`, `verify_biometric`, `submit_kyc`, `verify_location`
- Proper OTP verification flow for each tier upgrade
- Fixed consent verification before tier upgrade

### 5. ✅ Created ErrorBoundary Component

**Features**:
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly UI
- Development mode shows detailed error information
- Try Again, Reload Page, and Go Home options
- Prevents app crashes from propagating

### 6. ✅ Created KYC Route

**Features**:
- Document upload endpoint for tier 3 upgrades
- Supports national ID, passport, driver's license
- File validation and secure storage
- Ready for blockchain integration

### 7. ✅ Fixed Pool Tier Requirements

**Solution**:
- Set harvest pool to Tier 0 (phone number only)
- Updated backend `POOL_TIER_REQUIREMENTS`
- Updated frontend `REQUIRED_TIER` constant
- Created `admin-pool-tiers.json` configuration

## Correct Consent Flow

### Tier Progression:
1. **Tier 0**: Phone number verified (automatic on wallet creation)
2. **Tier 1**: Device registered (requires OTP consent)
3. **Tier 2**: Biometric verified (requires OTP + device check)
4. **Tier 3**: KYC submitted (requires OTP + device + biometric)
5. **Tier 4**: Location verified (requires all previous + location)

### Smart Contract Integration:
- ConsentManager tracks all verified actions
- Each OTP can only be used once
- Tier calculated from verified actions count
- No local storage fallback

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Working:
- Wallet creation flow with local consent storage
- Blockchain tier reading (always Tier 0 after creation)
- OTP consent verification
- Device registration modal with proper flow
- Biometric registration (WebAuthn)
- Location verification
- Pool investment with tier checks
- Admin tier management
- Error boundaries preventing crashes

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
- React hooks error resolved
- No more blockchain registration during wallet creation
- Proper tier display from blockchain only
- Device/biometric registration guides to Settings
- Pool tier requirements configurable
- Error handling improved throughout

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **Test Tier Upgrades**: 
   - Verify each tier upgrade path works correctly
   - Test OTP flow for each action

2. **Admin Panel**:
   - Test tier management features
   - Verify pool tier requirement updates

3. **User Testing**:
   - Clear browser cache/localStorage
   - Test fresh wallet creation
   - Test existing wallet tier upgrades

## Important Notes

- Always clear browser cache after tier system changes
- Blockchain tier is source of truth (no local fallback)
- OTP required for all tier upgrades
- Device/biometric during onboarding only stores locally
