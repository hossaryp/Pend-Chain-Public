# Simplified Verification UI System

## Overview
The wallet UI has been simplified to remove the tier system and replace it with a clean verification checklist. This provides a more intuitive user experience without confusing tier levels.

## Key Changes

### 1. Wallet Creation Flow
- **Simplified Steps**: Only phone verification and wallet creation
- **No Consent Screens**: Device, biometric, and location setup moved to settings
- **Direct to Success**: After OTP, users go straight to success screen

### 2. Settings Tab Verification List
Instead of tiers, users now see a simple "Security Verifications" section with:

- **Device Registration**
  - Shows "Register Device" button or "Device(s) registered" ✓
  - Lists all registered devices with management options
  
- **Location Verification**  
  - Shows "Set Location" button or "Location set" ✓
  - Displays verified location details when complete
  
- **Biometric Authentication**
  - Shows "Set Biometric" button or "Biometric set" ✓
  - Uses WebAuthn for secure biometric storage

### 3. Progress Experience
The wallet creation progress now shows 5 clear steps:
1. Phone Verified - "Great! Your number is confirmed."
2. Consent Recorded - "Your permission is now on the ledger."
3. Smart Wallet Deployed - "Creating your secure wallet on PendChain."
4. Identity Linked - "Only you can access this wallet."
5. All Set! - "You're ready to explore real assets."

### 4. Welcome Screen Updates
- **Existing Wallet Support**: Shows "Enter App" for returning users
- **No Auto-redirect**: Users must click to proceed
- **Clean Design**: Sprouting seed illustration with value propositions

### 5. Removed Components
- All tier badges and indicators
- Tier progress bars
- Tier requirements in opportunity cards
- "Under Review" status complexity

## User Benefits
1. **Clarity**: No confusion about tier levels or requirements
2. **Control**: Users choose when to add security features
3. **Simplicity**: Clean UI with clear actions
4. **Flexibility**: Add verifications anytime from settings

## Technical Implementation
- Modular modal components for each verification type
- Local storage for immediate UI updates
- Blockchain verification happens separately with OTP
- No tier calculations or hybrid tier logic in UI

## Migration Notes
For existing users:
- Their verifications remain intact
- Settings show current verification status
- Can add missing verifications anytime
- No tier display but same security features
