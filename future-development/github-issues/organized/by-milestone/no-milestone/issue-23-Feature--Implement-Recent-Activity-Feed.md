## Description
üß† Problem Summary
Users need visibility into their most recent actions ‚Äî investments, redemptions, or pending transactions ‚Äî to build trust and give feedback on platform interactions. Currently, there is no activity log in the Your Investments tab, leaving users unaware of what actions have been executed or are in progress.

üéØ Objective
Display a clean, mobile-friendly activity feed showing the user's 4 most recent transactions. Each entry should clearly state the action, amount, timestamp, and transaction status using visual tags.

üîç Scope of Work

Title: Recent Activity

Style: text-sm, font-semibold, text-black

Padding: px-4, mt-6, mb-2

Styling:

Base: text-xs, px-2 py-1, rounded-full
