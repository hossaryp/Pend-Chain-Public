## Description
roblem Summary
In Pend Beta, users do not fund a balance in advance. Instead, they initiate a payment directly when investing in an asset. This flow must be simple, clear, and legally compliant ‚Äî ensuring user agreement, consent, and structured payment instruction before proceeding.

üéØ Objective
Design and implement a payment initiation flow that begins only after the user selects an asset, agrees to investment terms, and confirms consent. The user then selects a payment method and follows instructions to complete the transaction.

üîç Scope of Work
‚úÖ Entry Point
Triggered from Invest Now CTA on any asset

Investment form appears only after:

User views asset details

User accepts investment terms

Consent signature is recorded via ConsentManager

‚úÖ Payment Method Selection Screen
UI shows available methods:

Bank Transfer

Credit/Debit Card

Layout:

Title: "Select Payment Method"

Each method as a styled card with icon + short description

On selection, proceed to instructions

‚úÖ Payment Instruction Screen
Based on chosen method:

Bank Transfer:

Show: Bank Name, Account Number/IBAN, Reference Code

Instructional text: ‚ÄúPlease transfer the exact amount and include your reference code.‚Äù

Credit Card:

Show: mock form or placeholder (no actual gateway)

Button: "Confirm Payment" ‚Üí mock confirmation

‚úÖ Metadata Logging & Status
Store in backend:

User identity hash

Asset ID

Consent signature hash

Initial status: pending

Show user:

Confirmation screen: "Payment Pending"

Optional: link to transaction activity or wallet

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
 Payment flow starts only after terms are accepted

 Clear, method-specific instructions shown

 Confirm button logs metadata and triggers consent signature

 Fully styled to match Pend guidelines (Poppins, orange accents, white background)
