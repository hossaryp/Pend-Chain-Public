## Description
üß† Problem Summary
Currently, users cannot end their session within the Pend Beta app. Without a logout feature, user sessions persist indefinitely, which poses security and privacy concerns. A logout button is essential for session management, especially on shared or mobile devices.

üéØ Objective
Add a logout button at the bottom of the Profile tab that:

Clears the user's session and local data

Simulates logout behavior by redirecting to the login or welcome screen

Follows Pend‚Äôs visual style and mobile responsiveness

üîç Scope of Work
‚úÖ UI Design
Button Text: Logout

Style:

Text color: text-red-500

Outline: border border-red-200

Border radius: rounded-lg

Font: text-sm, font-medium

Spacing: mx-4 mt-4 mb-6, py-2 px-4, full-width

Placement:

Bottom of the Profile tab, below all settings and support sections

‚úÖ Functionality
On click:

Clear all session-related data (mocked or real)

Local storage / context / state cleanup

Optionally reset navigation stack

Redirect to:

Login screen (if available), or

Welcome/landing screen

Add console.log("User logged out") for dev feedback

‚úÖ Optional Enhancement
Show a confirmation modal:

Title: ‚ÄúAre you sure you want to logout?‚Äù

Buttons: Cancel / Confirm

Only if time allows

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
 Logout button is styled and visible on all mobile screen sizes

 Clicking it clears session and redirects user to login/welcome

 Uses proper spacing, color, and font per Pend guidelines

 (Optional) Confirmation modal is shown before logout

 No bugs on repeated logout attempts or back navigation

‚è≥ Priority
HIGH ‚Äî Critical for security, especially in mobile-first applications
