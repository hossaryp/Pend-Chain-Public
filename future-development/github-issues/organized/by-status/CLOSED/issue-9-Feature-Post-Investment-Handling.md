## Description
üìå Problem Summary
After an investment is confirmed, users must receive immediate and clear confirmation. Additionally, once they‚Äôve accepted the terms and agreement checkbox, they are considered legally approved to proceed. However, the current UX lacks strong visibility into what happens next and where to see the updated investment.

üéØ Objective
Redirect users to the Wallet tab after a successful investment, where they can view their contribution. Ensure the system logs the transaction and reflects it clearly in the transaction history.

üß© Scope

Redirect & Confirmation

After successful investment:

Show a visible success message (toast or full-screen banner)

Automatically redirect to /wallet

Logging & History

Add a new entry to the transaction history

Include:

Pool name

Amount invested

Currency

Timestamp

Status should default to "Invested"

Legal Acknowledgment

Ensure that once the user has checked the agreement box during investment, the platform recognizes them as legally approved

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

Investment success triggers redirect to Wallet

Wallet displays updated balance or holdings

Success feedback is clear and instant

Transaction is listed in history with accurate metadata

No further agreement prompts after consent is recorded

‚è≥ Priority
MEDIUM ‚Äì critical for clarity, retention, and legal audit trail
