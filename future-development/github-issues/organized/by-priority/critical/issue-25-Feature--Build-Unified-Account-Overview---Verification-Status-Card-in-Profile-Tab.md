## Description
üß† Problem Summary
The current profile experience is fragmented ‚Äî user info and verification status are split across multiple components. This makes it harder for users to understand their identity status, what‚Äôs left to complete, and how close they are to being verified. A unified card solves this and gives a clean, guided user experience.

üéØ Objective
Create a single combined card inside the Profile tab that displays:

User ID

‚ÄúUser Since‚Äù date

Total Invested

Verification status: 1/5 steps complete

Step label: "Next: Complete Profile Information"

Status tag:

If all steps complete ‚Üí Verified (orange text + border)

If incomplete ‚Üí Not Verified (gray border, filled text)

Include a CTA button to ‚ÄúComplete Profile Now‚Äù.
