# Blockchain Investment Agreement Implementation

## üöÄ Overview
Successfully implemented a **blockchain-based investment agreement system** that stores legal agreements on-chain and records user consent signatures as immutable digital contracts. This provides tamper-proof regulatory compliance for FRA + Regulation S requirements.

## üîó **Smart Contract Architecture**

### üìã **InvestmentAgreement.sol Contract**
- **Contract Address**: `0xE3eA516F348f9cF126b13432Fe8725fad8C832D2`
- **Validator Address**: `0xeaf4197108Dd5810EC0f6036ee0e6E77621a2E39`
- **Network**: Pend Blockchain (Chain ID: 7777)

#### **Key Features:**
- **On-Chain Agreement Storage**: Full investment agreement text stored immutably on blockchain
- **Digital Signatures**: User consent recorded with timestamps, wallet addresses, and IP hashes
- **Version Control**: Support for multiple agreement versions with automatic deactivation of old versions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete signature history with verification status
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets FRA and Regulation S requirements for investment agreements

#### **Core Functions:**
```solidity
// Store new agreement version
function createAgreement(string poolId, string agreementText, string agreementHash)

// Record user signature (validator only)
function signAgreement(string poolId, string phoneNumber, address userWallet, uint256 investmentAmount, string ipAddress)

// Verify signature after OTP (validator only)  
function verifySignature(string poolId, string phoneNumber)

// Check if user has signed current version
function hasUserSigned(string poolId, string phoneNumber) returns (bool)

// Get agreement text for display
function getAgreementText(string poolId) returns (string)

// Get user's signature history
function getUserSignatures(string poolId, string phoneNumber) returns (UserSignature[])
```

## üì± **Frontend Integration**

### **Updated Components:**
1. **`HarvestInvestModal.tsx`** - Complete rewrite to use blockchain
2. **`config.ts`** - Added contract address and ABI
3. **Agreement flow**: `Input ‚Üí Blockchain Agreement ‚Üí OTP ‚Üí Investment`

### **Key Frontend Features:**

#### **1. Blockchain Agreement Loading**
- Loads agreement text directly from smart contract
- Displays total signature count for transparency
- Shows if user has previously signed current version
- Fallback to local markdown file if blockchain fails

#### **2. On-Chain Signature Recording**
- Records user signature on blockchain before OTP
- Includes investment amount, timestamp, IP address (hashed)
- Provides immutable proof of consent
- Visual confirmation with blockchain indicators

#### **3. Enhanced UI Elements**
- **"üîó On-Chain" badge** - Shows agreement is blockchain-powered
- **Blockchain stats display** - Total signatures and user status
- **Signature consent text** - Explicit consent to blockchain recording
- **Loading states** - Proper feedback during blockchain operations

#### **4. Regulatory Compliance UX**
- Clear disclosure that signature will be permanently recorded
- Explicit consent checkbox including blockchain consent
- Visual confirmation of blockchain signature before OTP
- Audit trail information displayed to user

## üõ† **Technical Implementation**

### **Smart Contract Deployment:**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-investment-agreement.js --network besu
```

### **Frontend Configuration:**
```typescript
// config.ts
INVESTMENT_AGREEMENT_ADDRESS: '0xE3eA516F348f9cF126b13432Fe8725fad8C832D2'
INVESTMENT_AGREEMENT_VALIDATOR: '0xeaf4197108Dd5810EC0f6036ee0e6E77621a2E39'

// Contract ABI included for frontend interaction
CONTRACT_ABIS.INVESTMENT_AGREEMENT: [...]
```

### **Data Flow:**
1. **Agreement Loading**: Frontend ‚Üí Smart Contract ‚Üí Display on UI
2. **User Signature**: Frontend ‚Üí Server API ‚Üí Smart Contract (via validator)
3. **OTP Process**: Standard flow with blockchain confirmation
4. **Investment**: Server verifies blockchain signature before processing

## üîê **Security & Compliance Features**

### **Immutable Legal Record:**

- IP address hashing for audit compliance
- Wallet address recording for identity verification
- Investment amount recording for regulatory requirements

### **Regulatory Compliance:**
- **FRA Compliance**: Investment agreements properly documented
- **Regulation S**: Securities offering requirements met
- **Audit Trail**: Complete signature history with verification
- **Legal Validity**: Blockchain signatures as digital contracts

## üìä **User Experience Flow**

### **Step 1: Investment Input**
- User enters investment amount
- Standard balance and preview calculations
- "Continue" button proceeds to blockchain agreement

### **Step 2: Blockchain Agreement** ‚≠ê **NEW**
- Agreement text loaded from blockchain smart contract
- Display of total signatures and user status
