1. **`PaymentMethodSelection.tsx`** - Payment method selection UI
2. **`DepositFlow.tsx`** - Unified deposit flow for all currencies
3. **Updated `DepositPage.tsx`** - Now supports all currencies

### Types Added
```typescript
export type PaymentMethod = 'bank_transfer' | 'apple_pay' | 'google_pay' | 'coinbase_pay' | 'binance_pay' | 'card_payment' | 'mobile_wallet' | 'insta_pay';

## 🔄 User Experience Flow

### Before
1. Select Currency → 2. Enter Amount → 3. Deposit
